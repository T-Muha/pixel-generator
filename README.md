# pixel-generator
Alters an image to resemble pixel art. I wrote the filters myself without using any outside resources as a challenge to see if I could 
generate pixel art. The results are best if you use paintings or simple photos. Things such as forests can be visually confusing.
I have included some example photos to demonstrate this.

# Installing/Running
As of now there is only the Python download. There will soon be an installable application once I figure out Kivy's broken dependencies.

You will first need to install all of the required modules. They are Kivy and PIL. I highly reccomend using a Python virtual environment so other packages don't interfere with Kivy (they will).

Example Using pip:
* pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy_deps.sdl2==0.1.22 kivy_deps.glew==0.1.12
* pip install kivy_deps.gstreamer==0.1.17
* pip install kivy==1.11.1
* pip install pil
